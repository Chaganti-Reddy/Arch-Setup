Then I find myself in a difficult stage intitially to do that, but eventually I started to respect their ideas and think about executing them.  Finally we won the tournament as a team. \n\n\nAfter that for my undegraduation I moved into northern part of my country. Since childhood I born and brought up in southern part of India, but that time I went into a whole different community. We are a class of 120 students. There are some students from western part of the country and others from eastern as well. Different languages for each person and difficult to communicate with each other intitially. Not only language but also food is an issues for us, since India a very diverse country with more than 700 languages and more than a 1000 different food recipies, where each and every community uses their own. There are students coming from economically lower backgrounds and the others from wealthy family. \n\nNot only that, but also the way of thinking and the way of living is different for each and every person. But I started to understand the importance of being a part of a community. I started to respect each and every person's ideas and started to understand their way of living.

But we as a single community all celebrated and enjoyed each and every festival and we enlargen our diversity among us. As we are compuiter science students, we participated in multiple hackathons, events as a team. Not only hackathons, but also participated in the fests and competed in sporting events. We all together enjoyed to the fullest in my undegraduation studies.\n\n\nSo doing masters not only boosts my knowledge but also gives access to be a part in that huge diversity and I loves to do that.
