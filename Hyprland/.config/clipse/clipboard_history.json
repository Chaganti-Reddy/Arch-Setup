The hypothesis posits that each vehicle should\nreach a pickup point, considered a boarding location, before proceed-\ning to the designated destination. At each pickup point, a list of one or\nmore passengers departing from that specific location exists. The primary\nobjective of this study is to minimize the overall transportation cost by\nenhancing routing efficiency while accounting for application constraints,\ncapacity limitations, and time constraints. To achieve this, we propose a\nmathematical model encompassing various boarding and dropping points\nwith diverse time periods to enhance vehicle routing. The subsequent\nphase focuses on the ant colony optimization algorithm, addressing the\nproblem comprehensively within its expansive scope. Finally, to validate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we conduct tests on real-\nworld data to ascertain its practical viability.","recorded":"2024-10-10 16:01:11.156488946","filePath":"null","pinned":false},{"value":"/home/karna/Downloads/LOR check list .docx","recorded":"2024-10-10 15:58:11.341078197","filePath":"null","pinned":false},{"value":"The strength of Mr. Venkatarami Reddy lies in his ability to adapt and embed his knowledge into various real world problems with his research ability.
