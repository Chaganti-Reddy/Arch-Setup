His enthusiasm towards the subject has always made the class more interactive as he would ask questions and introduce discussions. His interpersonal skills allow him to get along with his peers. He illustrated eminent verbal articulation in the project seminar, which was an integral part of the course.\n\nDuring his second year he started AI \u0026 ML club.  His main intention was to share the profound knowledge that he has on AI \u0026 ML to his peers and his juniors. Initially, he did not get facilitated with enough resources \u0026 support. However, with an unwavering determination and commitment he formed a club \u0026 actively participated and engaged all the members of the club to participate in many hackathons. Not just restricted to active participation. He made his team win some of them. This shows his team work \u0026 excellent leadership skills. During these 4 years I've noticed he has developed overall not just academically but also personally. I had the privilege to recommend him to multiple internship positions.\n\nObserving Venkat over four years, I firmly believe that he has the potential to succeed in all of his future endeavors, both academically and professionally. His academic knowledge, perseverance, and attitude will ensure his ascent to greater heights. I am confident that he/she will be a valuable asset to your cohort.
