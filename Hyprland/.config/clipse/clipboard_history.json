It was in my 10th standard that I started to understand the importance of being a part of a community. Because it was the first time where I have to work in a team of different people as a part of my cricket tournament where I was the captain of my team. Where I got to know the importance of being a team player and I got to know that it's important to understand each and every person and their ideas. Then I find myself in a difficult stage intitially to do that, but eventually I started to respect their ideas and think about executing them.  Finally we won the tournament as a team. \n\n\nAfter that for my undegraduation I moved into northern part of my country. Since childhood I born and brought up in southern part of India, but that time I went into a whole different community. We are a class of 120 students. There are some students from western part of the country and others from eastern as well. Different languages for each person and difficult to communicate with each other intitially. Not only language but also food is an issues for us, since India a very diverse country with more than 700 languages and more than a 1000 different food recipies, where each and every community uses their own. There are students coming from economically lower backgrounds and the others from wealthy family. \n\nNot only that, but also the way of thinking and the way of living is different for each and every person. But I started to understand the importance of being a part of a community. I started to respect each and every person's ideas and started to understand their way of living. I started to learn their languages and started to eat their food. In India there are huge number of festivals celebrated by more that 700 communities. But we as a single community all celebrated and enjoyed each and every festival and we enlargen our diversity among us. As we are compuiter science students, we participated in multiple hackathons, events as a team. Not only hackathons, but also participated in the fests and competed in sporting events. We all together enjoyed to the fullest in my undegraduation studies.\n\n\nSo doing masters not only boosts my knowledge but also gives access to be a part in that huge diversity and I loves to do that. I am very much excited to be a part of that community and I am very much excited to learn new things from them.\n","recorded":"2024-10-04 15:00:14.050321306","filePath":"null","pinned":false},{"value":"3A22-1EA6","recorded":"2024-10-04 14:38:26.767590513","filePath":"null","pinned":false},{"value":"bind = $mainMod, L, exec, hyprlock \u0026\n","recorded":"2024-10-04 13:17:00.351609284","filePath":"null","pinned":false},{"value":"Bhavanâ€™s  Vivekananda  college","recorded":"2024-10-04 13:12:45.890392902","filePath":"null","pinned":false},{"value":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/hymashree-kachiraju/","recorded":"2024-10-04 13:12:24.981732933","filePath":"null","pinned":false},{"value":"hymashreekachiraju@gmail.com","recorded":"2024-10-04 13:11:14.860971534","filePath":"null","pinned":false},{"value":"Hyderabad-500047, Telangana","recorded":"2024-10-04 13:10:59.902099809","filePath":"null","pinned":false},{"value":"Hymashree Kachiraju","recorded":"2024-10-04 13:10:44.361750797","filePath":"null","pinned":false},{"value":"/home/karna/.config/clipse","recorded":"2024-10-04 12:41:23.253522475","filePath":"null","pinned":false},{"value":"\"keyBindings\": {\n        \"choose\": \"enter\",\n        \"clearSelected\": \"S\",\n        \"down\": \"down\",\n        \"end\": \"end\",\n        \"filter\": \"/\",\n        \"home\": \"home\",\n        \"more\": \"?\",\n        \"nextPage\": \"right\",\n        \"prevPage\": \"left\",\n        \"preview\": \"t\",\n        \"quit\": \"q\",\n        \"remove\": \"x\",\n        \"selectDown\": \"ctrl+down\",\n        \"selectSingle\": \"s\",\n        \"selectUp\": \"ctrl+up\",\n        \"togglePin\": \"p\",\n        \"togglePinned\": \"tab\",\n        \"up\": \"up\",\n        \"yankFilter\": \"ctrl+s\"\n     },\n    \"imageDisplay\": {\n        \"type\": \"basic\",\n        \"scaleX\": 9,\n        \"scaleY\": 9,\n        \"heightCut\": 2\n     }","recorded":"2024-10-04 12:37:13.274450944","filePath":"null","pinned":false},{"value":"/home/karna/Pictures/WallPapers/1.jpg","recorded":"2024-10-04 12:35:09.301182055","filePath":"null","pinned":false}]}
