This study proposes a Court Judgment Prediction and Recommendation (CJPR) system to modernize judicial decision-making through artificial intelligence (AI). By streamlining judicial processes, reducing case backlogs, and enhancing decision-making fairness, the CJPR system leverages advanced computational techniques to analyze Supreme Court cases in India from its inception to 2023. Customizable models are developed for criminal and civil cases, utilizing both classical and state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, including transformer models, on GPU and TPU platforms. Data-dependent algorithms employing advanced natural language processing methods are used to extensively train the models for improved prediction accuracy. The system also recommends relevant historical cases to assist legal professionals in decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate an X% improvement in prediction accuracy and a Y% reduction in case analysis time compared to existing approaches. This research introduces a transformative application of AI in the judicial domain, providing a robust framework for improving the efficiency and quality of legal judgments while paving the way for future advancements in justice delivery systems.","recorded":"2024-12-22 16:08:11.038466287","filePath":"null","pinned":false},{"value":"The judicial system is an essential component of a functioning democratic state.
