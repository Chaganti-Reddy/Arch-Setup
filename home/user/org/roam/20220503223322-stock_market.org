* Goals
To predict the stock market graph
* Tasks
*** TODO First to print the Bollinger Graph
***** Bollinger grapgh contains three graphs in a plot first is Upper Bollinger Band(Upper Standard deviation) and middle is Average data and lowest is Lower Bollinger Band(Lower Standard deviation) .

**** To calculate the thos standard deviation

#+begin_src Text
BOLU=MA(TP,n)+m∗σ[TP,n]

BOLD=MA(TP,n)−m∗σ[TP,n]

Where BOLU is the Upper Bollinger Band and BOLD is Lower Bollinger Band. The MA is the Moving Average. The TP and σ are calculated as follows.

TP (typical price)=(High+Low+Close)÷3

σ[TP,n] = Standard Deviation over last n periods of TP​

Where n is the number of days in smoothing period (typically 20), and m is the number of standard deviations (typically 2).
#+end_src

***** To calculate those values for given dataset

#+begin_src python
# import pandas_datareader as pdr
import datetime as dt
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.style.use('default')

ticker = pd.read_csv('Stock/15min.csv')
ticker['TP'] = (ticker['close'] + ticker['low'] + ticker['high'])/3
ticker['std'] = ticker['TP'].rolling(20).std(ddof=0)
ticker['MA-TP'] = ticker['TP'].rolling(20).mean()
ticker['BOLU'] = ticker['MA-TP'] + 2*ticker['std']
ticker['BOLD'] = ticker['MA-TP'] - 2*ticker['std']
# ticker = ticker.dropna()
print(ticker)
# Plotting it all together
ax = ticker[['close', 'BOLU', 'BOLD']].plot(color=['blue', 'orange', 'yellow'])
ax.fill_between(ticker.index, ticker['BOLD'], ticker['BOLU'], facecolor='orange', alpha=0.1)
plt.show()
