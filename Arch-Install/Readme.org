* DISK CONFIGURATION

**** This configuration is for `UEFI & GPT Partitioning` .

1. Enter these commands as below : `Here name == /dev/diskname` (Like /dev/nvme1n1 or /dev/sda1 ...)

   a. Enter `gdisk "name"`
   b. Now enter the commands as per your diskspace usage with the same arguments as shown in figure below:

   c. After writing the changes to your disk type lsblk and that shows you the partitions

* INSTALLING BASE PACKAGES

**** Now we have to install some base packages which are needed to continu7e our installation process

+ Enter the below command to install the base packages :

  #+begin_src shell
  pacstrap /mnt base linux-lts linux-lts-headers linux-firmware nano intel-ucode git openssh
  #+end_src

#+begin_quote
+ Here you can use linux and linux-headers instead of linux-lts if you want to use latest unstable kernal, but if you want to use latest stable kernal then do it for linux-lts

+ Also you have to install amd-ucode if your machine is amd and also install your favourite terminal text-editor (nano is better in my opinion)
#+end_quote

**** Now after completition of installation we have to generate fstab file which is useful for loading our disks on start-up of machine

#+begin_src shell
genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
# Now we have to enter as root into out /mnt directory
arch-chroot /mnt
#+end_src
