** To plot the Relative strength index of Data
**** The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other asset. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph that moves between two extremes) and can have a reading from 0 to 100.

*** To calculate RSI


\begin{equation} RSI_n  =  100 - (100/(1+rs_n)) \end{equation}
\begin{equation} rs_n = (avg\_gain / avg\_loss) \end{equation}

where

    avg_gain  is average gain over time window (period)
    avg_loss  is average loss over time window (period)
    n  signifies computational step

**** Gains - datapoints that fit following condition:

+ when there was price increase compared to previous day, gain is equal to that price gain value, otherwise set to zero

**** Losses - datapoints that fit following condition:

+ when there was price decrease compared to previous day, loss is equal to that price loss value, otherwise set to zero

  When RSI values are:

****** above 70, asset is considered overbought (overvalued)
****** below 30, asset is considered oversold (undervalued)

+ Even better is to look at divergence between price and RSI values:

****** bullish divergence: price is trending down, RSI values are increasing (possible Long entry)
****** bearish divergence: price is th=rending up, RSI values are decreasing (possible Short entry)
