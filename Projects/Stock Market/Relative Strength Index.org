** To plot the Relative strength index of Data
**** The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other asset. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph that moves between two extremes) and can have a reading from 0 to 100.

*** To calculate RSI


RSI_{n}  =  100 - (100/(1+rs_{n}))
rs_{n} = (avg_gain / avg_loss)

\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\)

The /Euler theorem/:

\[
\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = {{\sqrt{\pi}} \over {2}}
\]

LaTeX allows to inline such ~\[...\]~ constructs (/quadratic formula/):
\[ \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4 a c}}{2a} \]

where

    avg_gain  is average gain over time window (period)
    avg_loss  is average loss over time window (period)
    n  signifies computational step

**** Gains - datapoints that fit following condition:

+ when there was price increase compared to previous day, gain is equal to that price gain value, otherwise set to zero

**** Losses - datapoints that fit following condition:

+ when there was price decrease compared to previous day, loss is equal to that price loss value, otherwise set to zero

  When RSI values are:

****** above 70, asset is considered overbought (overvalued)
****** below 30, asset is considered oversold (undervalued)

+ Even better is to look at divergence between price and RSI values:

****** bullish divergence: price is trending down, RSI values are increasing (possible Long entry)
****** bearish divergence: price is th=rending up, RSI values are decreasing (possible Short entry)
