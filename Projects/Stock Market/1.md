## To plot the Relative strength index of Data

1.  The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions in the price of a stock or other asset. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph that moves between two extremes) and can have a reading from 0 to 100.

### To calculate RSI

\begin{equation} RSI_n = 100 - (100/(1+rs_n)) \end{equation}

\begin{equation} rs_n = (avg_gain / avg_loss) \end{equation}

h<sub>&theta;</sub>(x) = &theta;<sub>o</sub> x + &theta;<sub>1</sub>x

    where

        avg_gain  is average gain over time window (period)
        avg_loss  is average loss over time window (period)
        n  signifies computational step

1.  Gains - datapoints that fit following condition:

    - when there was price increase compared to previous day, gain is equal to that price gain value, otherwise set to zero

2.  Losses - datapoints that fit following condition:

    - when there was price decrease compared to previous day, loss is equal to that price loss value, otherwise set to zero

      When RSI values are:

    1.  above 70, asset is considered overbought (overvalued)

    2.  below 30, asset is considered oversold (undervalued)

        - Even better is to look at divergence between price and RSI values:

    3.  bullish divergence: price is trending down, RSI values are increasing (possible Long entry)

    4.  bearish divergence: price is th=rending up, RSI values are decreasing (possible Short entry)
